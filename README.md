# Light Chat

### Legend

Very simple and lightweight chat. The project was created during <br />
the **war in Ukraine**, when **russian pig-dogs** fired missiles at the <br />
infrastructure, and as result was a complete power outage. <br />
Internet 4G/LTE didn't work, only E/GPRS worked at a very low speed.
